## Agent Reports Overview

### 1. UI/UX Optimization Agent
**67 issues identified**

#### Critical Issues
- ❌ Navigation missing "About" link (site has about.html but no nav link)
- ✅ FIXED: "Get for Windows" button misleading (web app, not Windows software)
- ❌ Contact.html form uses `type="text"` instead of `<textarea>` for message field
- ❌ Pricing toggle lacks keyboard accessibility (uses divs instead of button/checkbox)

#### High Priority
- Contact form has 4 fields (too many - each field reduces conversion by 11%)
- Pricing page FAQ items not interactive enough (should be accordions)
- Typography inconsistencies across pages
- Missing hover states on interactive elements

#### Recommendation: Fix navigation structure and form accessibility this week

---

### 2. SEO Optimization Agent
**45+ issues identified**

#### Critical Issues
- ✅ FIXED: Missing canonical URLs on all pages
- ✅ FIXED: No Open Graph images for social sharing
- ❌ Duplicate/wrong title tags:

  - blog.html: "Projects – SEOLOGY.AI" (should be "SEO Blog")
- ❌ Missing H1 tags on pricing.html and about.html
- ❌ No schema markup anywhere (FAQ, Product, Organization)

#### High Priority

#### Critical Issues
- ✅ FIXED: Render-blocking jQuery (now deferred)
- ✅ FIXED: Render-blocking webflow.js (now deferred)

- ❌ Duplicate logo images loaded (regular + alternate for hover)

#### High Priority
- Missing font preloading strategy
- No resource hints (dns-prefetch, preconnect) for CDNs
- Pricing page has 72 lines of unminified inline JavaScript
- Images loaded eagerly when should be lazy loaded

#### Asset Optimization
- Frame-1.jpg through Frame-12.jpg images: 200-400KB each

**Estimated Performance Gains:**

- ❌ FAQ accordions missing aria-expanded, aria-controls attributes

- Pricing comparison table uses divs instead of semantic `<table>` elements
- Links lack context ("Read more →" needs aria-label)
- No visible focus indicators on custom-styled elements

#### Color Contrast Issues

#### Recommendation: Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements, test color contrast

---

### 5. Copy/Content Optimization Agent
**42 content issues identified**

#### Critical Copy Issues
- ✅ FIXED: "Let's Create Your SEO?" grammatically awkward

  - **Suggested**: "The First SEO Platform That Actually Fixes Issues (Not Just Reports Them)"
- ❌ About page copy is generic marketing fluff, lacks origin story
- ❌ Contact page intro too verbose (44 words, should be 15-20)

#### Value Proposition Weaknesses
- Not enough emphasis on unique differentiator (auto-fix vs report)
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Missing urgency/scarcity messaging
- No customer testimonials or social proof visible

#### CTA Inconsistencies
- Current CTAs: "Get Started," "Get for Windows," "Contact Us," "Book Demo"
