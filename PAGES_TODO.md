## Current Status
- Created placeholder pages using existing templates
- Navigation updated to: Pricing | Enterprise | Careers | Blog
- Landing page fully designed (needs implementation)
- Need proper content structures for:

### 1. Pricing Page
**Needed:** 3-tier pricing (like Cluely)
- **Free Tier**: Limited sites, basic auto-fix
- **Pro ($29/mo)**: Unlimited sites, priority support
- **Enterprise (Custom)**: Team features, SSO, dedicated support

### 2. Enterprise Page
**Needed:** Focus on team/agency features
- Bulk site management
- Team collaboration
- White-label reports
- API access
- Dedicated account manager

### 3. Careers Page
**Needed:** Simple job listing page
- Company mission
- Open positions (or "No openings currently")
- Culture/values

### 4. Blog Page
**Needed:** Blog list layout
- Article cards
- Categories/tags
- Search
- CTA to subscribe

## Quick Action Items
For now, pages have basic headers and descriptions. They function but need:
1. Proper pricing table component
2. Feature comparison grid
3. FAQ sections specific to each page type
4. Better CTAs

## Notes
- All pages use existing Craflow template structure
- Footer and nav are consistent across all pages
- Can rebuild with custom components later
