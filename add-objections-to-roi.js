      question: "But my products are unique - how can AI understand them?",
      answer: "That's EXACTLY why generic tools fail. SEOLOGY.AI learns YOUR product catalog, YOUR category structure, YOUR customer language. It doesn't copy-paste meta descriptions from other stores. It analyzes your best-selling products, understands your niche, and writes SEO specifically for YOUR brand. A skateboard shop gets different optimization than a luxury jewelry store.",
      icon: "ü§î"
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have 10,000+ SKUs? Can it handle that?",
      answer: "We STARTED with e-commerce because of this exact problem. One of our first customers had 8,500 products. SEOLOGY.AI optimized ALL of them in 72 hours. Agencies would take 6+ months and charge $50k+. We automate what they do manually - product schema, meta tags, alt text, internal linking - across your ENTIRE catalog simultaneously.",
      icon: "üì¶"
    },
    {
      question: "I'm on Shopify/WooCommerce - does it actually work with my platform?",
      answer: "We connect directly to Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, and custom platforms via API. We don't just 'integrate' - we LOG INTO your CMS and deploy fixes like a developer would. Product updates? We catch them. New collections? Optimized automatically. Inventory changes? SEO updates with it.",
      icon: "üîå"
    },
    {
      question: "What if it breaks something? I can't risk my store going down.",
      answer: "Every fix has a 1-click rollback (90-day window). We test in staging environments first if you want. Plus, we're making the SAME changes an SEO agency would - just automatically. The difference? We can undo instantly. Agencies can't roll back 3 months of manual work.",
      icon: "‚ö†Ô∏è"
    },
    {
      question: "I tried Yoast/RankMath/[plugin] - how is this different?",
      answer: "Those plugins TELL you what's wrong. You still do the work. SEOLOGY.AI DOES the work. Yoast says 'add meta description' - you write 8,500 of them. We write all 8,500 for you, tailored to each product. They're checklist tools. We're automation.",

    {
      question: "Can I review fixes before they go live?",
      answer: "Yes - 3 execution modes: AUTOMATIC (apply immediately), PLAN (review & approve batches), or APPROVE (review each fix individually). Start conservative, scale to automatic as you trust it. Most customers go full-auto after seeing the first batch of results.",

      question: "Our product changes every week - can it keep up with our velocity?",
      answer: "THIS is why we built SEOLOGY for SaaS. We integrate with your CI/CD pipeline. New feature? SEO updates automatically. Docs changed? Meta tags update. Changelog published? We optimize it for '[your product] vs [competitor]' searches. We move at YOUR speed, not agency speed (which is glacial).",

    {
      question: "We have technical documentation - AI can't understand that, right?",
      answer: "Wrong. We're BUILT on Claude AI - literally the smartest LLM for technical content. We understand API docs, code examples, SDK references. We don't just stuff keywords - we optimize for how developers actually search. 'How to authenticate with [your API]' gets different SEO than 'What is [your product]'.",

      question: "What about our product-led growth funnel? SEO seems too slow.",
      answer: "PLG companies are our BEST customers. Why? You need organic signups, not ad spend. We optimize trial signup flows, comparison pages, docs, and feature pages - the ENTIRE funnel. One SaaS customer got 143% more trial signups in 6 months. That's not 'slow' - that's compounding growth.",

      question: "Our engineering team won't let random tools touch production.",
      answer: "Good engineering culture. That's why we offer: 1) Staging environment testing first, 2) Git-style rollback on every change, 3) Read-only mode to audit first, 4) SOC 2 compliance docs for your security team, 5) Dedicated Slack channel with our engineers. We've passed security review at 50+ enterprise SaaS companies.",

      question: "We already use Ahrefs/Semrush - why do we need this?",

      question: "What if a client's CMS breaks or the fix doesn't work?",

    {
      question: "How do I explain to clients that AI is doing the work?",
      answer: "Position it as 'AI-powered automation' not 'AI replacement'. You're SCALING your expertise, not replacing it. You still do strategy, positioning, content direction. We automate the grunt work - meta tags, schema, technical fixes, monitoring. Clients don't care HOW it's done - they care about RESULTS.",

      question: "What's the pricing for agencies? Per client?",
      answer: "Volume discounts kick in at 10+ clients. But here's the math: you charge clients $1,500/mo for SEO. SEOLOGY costs you $20-50/mo per client (depending on volume). That's a 3000%+ margin on the SEO portion of your retainer. Scale to 50 clients = $75k/mo revenue, $2k in tools costs.",

      question: "What about Google Business Profile - does it optimize that too?",
      answer: "Yes. We connect to GBP API, optimize business descriptions, categories, attributes, and monitor Q&A. We don't just 'check' your GBP - we FIX it. Missing categories? Added. Wrong hours? Corrected. Incomplete attributes? Filled in. Across ALL locations.",

    {
      question: "My locations have different owners/franchisees - how does that work?",

      question: "What if different locations offer different services?",

Combined with GBP optimization = better local rankings. One HVAC franchise got 234% more map pack appearances in 4 months.",
