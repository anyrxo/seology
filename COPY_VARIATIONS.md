## SOCIAL PROOF COPY

### Testimonial Structure Template
```
"[Specific Result with Number] in [Timeframe]. [What changed]. [Emotional Impact]."
— Name, Title at Company
```

### Example Testimonials (Use This Format)

**E-commerce Focus:**
"127% more organic traffic in 90 days. We went from 200 unfixed SEO issues to zero without our dev team touching anything. This freed up $4,000/month in developer costs."
— Sarah Chen, Marketing Director at Outdoor Gear Co.

**SaaS Focus:**
"We jumped to top 10 for 43 competitive keywords. SEOLOGY.AI found and fixed issues our previous SEO agency missed for 2 years. Paid for itself in week one."
— James Martinez, Founder at DataViz Pro

**Agency Focus:**
"Managing 73 client sites with just 2 SEO specialists. Before SEOLOGY.AI, we could only handle 15 sites. Our clients love seeing fixes happen automatically instead of waiting weeks for implementation."
— Emily Thompson, SEO Lead at Growth Partners Agency

## OBJECTION HANDLING (FAQ Copy)

### Objection: "Is it safe?"
**Weak Response:** "Yes, we use encryption."
**Strong Response:** ✅
"Absolutely. Every fix is logged with before/after snapshots. You can rollback any change within 90 days with one click. Plus, you choose your execution mode: auto-fix, review plans first, or approve each change individually. We use OAuth for Shopify (no passwords stored) and encrypt all WordPress credentials with 256-bit encryption."

### Objection: "How is this different from [competitor]?"
**Weak Response:** "We have more features."
**Strong Response:** ✅
"Tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, and Screaming Frog are excellent for finding and reporting SEO issues. But they stop there—they give you a list and say 'good luck.' SEOLOGY.AI actually logs into your CMS and makes the fixes for you. Think of us as the execution layer that turns their reports into action."

### Objection: "What if I don't like the changes?"
**Weak Response:** "You can review before we make changes."
**Strong Response:** ✅
"You have complete control. Choose 'Plan Mode' to review all fixes before they go live (one-click approval for the batch), or 'Approve Mode' to review each fix individually. Already applied? Every fix can be rolled back within 90 days with one click. If traffic drops or something looks wrong, undo instantly."

### Objection: "This sounds expensive."
**Weak Response:** "We have a free plan."
**Strong Response:** ✅
"Start completely free—no credit card required. You get 3 sites and 500 fixes per month at $0. Most customers save $3,000-$5,000/month in developer time, so even our Pro plan at $29/month pays for itself 100x over. Plus, every plan includes a 14-day free trial."
