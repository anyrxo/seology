## Writing Principles

### 1. **Lead with Benefits, Not Features**

**Features** describe what it is.
**Benefits** describe what it does for the user.

❌ "SEOLOGY.AI has Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration"
✅ "Claude AI analyzes your entire site in minutes, not hours"

❌ "90-day rollback functionality"
✅ "Undo any change within 90 days—complete peace of mind"

### 2. **Be Specific, Not Generic**

Specificity builds trust and credibility.

❌ "Improve your SEO"
✅ "Fix 50+ SEO issues automatically"

❌ "Fast setup"
✅ "Connect your site in 60 seconds"

❌ "Great results"
✅ "3.2x average traffic increase in 90 days"

### 3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**

Use concrete examples and scenarios.

❌ "SEOLOGY.AI helps e-commerce sites"
✅ "Automatically optimize 1,000+ product pages with perfect meta tags and alt text"

### 4. **One Idea Per Sentence**

Keep sentences focused and scannable.

❌ "SEOLOGY.AI uses Claude AI to analyze your site and automatically fix issues while also providing rollback functionality so you can undo changes if needed."
✅ "Claude AI analyzes your site and fixes issues automatically. Don't like a change? Roll it back within 90 days."

### 5. **Active Voice > Passive Voice**

Active voice is clearer and more engaging.

❌ "SEO issues are identified and fixed by our AI"
✅ "Our AI identifies and fixes SEO issues"

❌ "Your site will be analyzed automatically"
✅ "We analyze your site automatically"

### Numbers

- Spell out one through nine

## Final Notes

**This is a living document.** As SEOLOGY.AI evolves, so should our voice and copy standards. If you find exceptions, edge cases, or better approaches, suggest updates.

**When in doubt**:
1. Read it out loud—does it sound natural?
2. Show it to someone unfamiliar with SEO—do they understand?
3. Ask yourself: Would this convince ME to sign up?

**Remember**: Great copy is invisible. Users shouldn't notice the writing—they should just understand what to do and feel confident doing it.
