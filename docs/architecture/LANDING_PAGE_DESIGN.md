### Questions (Expandable Accordions)

**Q1: How does SEOLOGY.AI actually fix SEO issues?**
A: "We use secure API integrations to connect directly to your CMS (Shopify, WordPress, etc.). When Claude AI identifies an issue and generates a fix, we make the change directly in your database—just like a human would through the admin panel, but automated."

**Q2: Is it safe? What if something goes wrong?**
A: "Absolutely. Every fix is logged with before/after snapshots. You can rollback any change within 90 days with one click. Plus, you choose your execution mode: auto-fix, review plans first, or approve each change individually."

**Q3: What SEO issues can SEOLOGY.AI fix?**
A: "We fix: missing/duplicate meta titles & descriptions, broken internal links, missing alt text on images, duplicate content, poor heading structure, sitemap errors, robots.txt issues, schema markup problems, page speed issues, and more. Our AI learns new fixes regularly."

**Q4: Do I need to install anything?**
A: "For Shopify: No installation, just OAuth. For WordPress: Optional lightweight plugin (or use REST API). For custom sites: One JavaScript snippet. Setup takes under 2 minutes."

**Q5: How is this different from Semrush, Ahrefs, or Screaming Frog?**

A: "Yes! Many customers use Semrush/Ahrefs for keyword research and backlink analysis, then use SEOLOGY.AI to automatically implement the on-page fixes. We complement your existing stack."
