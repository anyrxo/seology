## Technical Details

### IX2 Animation Styles
Located in `<style>` block in `<head>`:
```css
@media (min-width:992px) {
  html.w-mod-js:not(.w-mod-ix) [data-w-id="..."] {
    transform: translate3d(0%, 0, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1)...
  }
}
```

### Animation Script
Located before `</body>`:
```html
<!-- Craflow Animation System v2 - Enhanced -->
<script>
  (function() {
    'use strict';
    // ~300 lines of animation logic
  })();
</script>
```

---

## Re-running the Script

If you need to restore or re-apply animations:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\manna\Downloads\iimagined.webflow (1)"

# Run the v2 script
node restore-craflow-animations-v2.js

# Output: Success messages for all 24 files
```

---

## Restore from Backup

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Restore all files from v2 backup
cd "c:\Users\manna\Downloads\iimagined.webflow (1)"
cp public/_animation_backup_v2/*.html public/

# Or restore a single file
cp public/_animation_backup_v2/index.html public/index.html
```
